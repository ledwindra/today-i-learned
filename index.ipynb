The solution which was suggested by Amazon themselves was to change my current location from Indonesia to anywhere else which Amazon offers (apparently the country that I'm living is not, albeit having done Kindle purchases several times without problems). But I guess it also depends on the publishers hence this thing happened to me. Finally, though, the book is on my device and I can't wait to spend time reading it!\n",
