# About
A list of my daily lessons. I don't set high expectations here. My rationale is that building a good habit might not be easy. So let's just find out how this goes. I also haven't thought the best format for this repository so it will be just a simple markdown.

Today I learned how to encode a string in Python using `[base64](https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html)` built-in module. This [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8908287/why-do-i-need-b-to-encode-a-string-with-base64) helps me through it. Following is my main usage:

```
>>> import base64

>>> base64.b64encode(encode)
b'YnV0IHlvdSBoYXZlIHRvIGRlY29kZSBpdA=='
```
